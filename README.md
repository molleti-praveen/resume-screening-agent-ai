# resume-screening-agent-ai
Agentic AI-based Resume Screening system using NLP and Machine Learning to score resumes and decide shortlist, reject, or human escalation using synthetic data.
# Resume Screening Agent (NLP + ML + Agentic AI)

## Overview
This project demonstrates an **Agentic AI-based Resume Screening System** that combines:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Agentic decision-making logic

The system evaluates resumes, assigns a probability score, and decides whether to **Shortlist**, **Reject**, or **Escalate to Human Review**.

This project is designed for **enterprise-style AI training and interview demonstrations** using synthetic data.

---

## Why This Project?
Enterprises receive a large number of resumes for every role.
Manual screening is:
- Time-consuming
- Inconsistent
- Difficult to scale

This agent shows how AI can assist HR teams by:
- Automating resume screening
- Applying consistent scoring logic
- Including human-in-the-loop escalation

## Key Concepts Explained

### NLP (Natural Language Processing)
Helps machines understand resume text.

### Machine Learning
Uses past examples to learn scoring patterns.

### Agentic AI
Allows the system to **decide next actions**, not just predict outcomes.

### Escalation Logic
Ensures uncertain cases are reviewed by humans.
